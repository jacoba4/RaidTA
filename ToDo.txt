Pre encounter editing
	Drag and drop units into scene
		Disable Unit/NPC script
		Have a max party size
		Do we want NPCs already spawned in? aka edit party for encounter, not edit encounter as well
		Add added units to RaidManager
			Numbers based on party index
		
	Edit their stats
		Click on unit to edit
		Some UI for this
		Edit hp, damage, heal, attack speed, range, move speed
		Button to delete
			Removes unit from RaidManager
			Adjusts all units' visible numbers later in the data structure
			
			
	Play Button
		this means we need to have framework in place to begin an encounter
			allow player party control input
			enable all Unit/NPC scripts
	
	Suggested party button? (stretch)
