Pre encounter editing
	Drag and drop units into scene
		Do we want NPCs already spawned in? aka edit party for encounter, not edit encounter as well
		Add added units to RaidManager during the setup phase
			Numbers based on party index
			prevents reinstantiation
		
	Edit their stats
		Click on unit to edit
		Some UI for this
		Edit hp, damage, heal, attack speed, range, move speed
		Button to delete
			Removes unit from RaidManager
			Adjusts all units' visible numbers later in the data structure

	Suggested party button? (stretch)
