What is RaidTA?

The main endgame content of modern MMORPGs are multiplayer raids, where a group of players fight a series of bosses. Many guides and videos describing how to perform raids exist, however personally, I much prefer a more hands-on approach to learning. Since most raid groups only meet at specific times, practicing these fights and mechanics is difficult. RaidTA aims to provide a program where players can practice and visually see the mechanics of raids without having to gather upwards of 19 other players.

Expected Progress

At the end of the semester I expect to have a fully working version of one fight in RaidTA. This includes player control, automation for the entire encounter (timers, mechanics, adds, etc.), as well as some balancing to make the fight more enjoyable and realistic for the simplified character controls in RaidTA.

Milestones

Basic player input

PC automation

Encounter and timer framework done

Visual Scripting Guide

As of now, there is no way for the user to create new visual scripting nodes.

Start() is called at the beginning of the encounter

Update() is called every frame

Nodes can be dragged using the left mouse button

Blue links are for the encounter execution path

Gray links are for input and output from/to nodes

Each can be linked by clicking and dragging

Use the "Done" button to continue to party customization once you are finished
