RaidTA

Concept
		The main endgame content of modern mmorpgs are multiplayer raids, where a group of players
	fight a series of bosses. Many guides and videos describing how to perform raids exist, however
	personally, I much prefer a more hands-on approach to learning. Since most raid groups only meet
	at specific times, practicing these fights and mechanics is difficult. RaidTA aims to provide a
	program where players can practice and visually see the mechanics of raids without having to 
	gather upwards of 19 other players.
	
		For now, raids will be taken from existing raids in World of Warcraft. In the future I may decide
	to take a more "gamified" route and create my own raids.
	
		Other future goals include choosing specific classes (warrior, mage, priest, etc.) which have specific
	and unique abilites.

Gameplay
		The player will be given a top down view of the raid. From this view, the player can see all the
	members of the raid (controlled by cpu), the boss(es), and all mechanics that are happening. There are
	two possible, closely related, paths that the game can take from here.
		
		Either the player controls only their character and handles their one role (tank, damage, heal) or
	the player controls the entire raid (with extremely simplified gameplay mechanics related to WoW).
	
		Single Control
			- More specific for that role
			- Requires much more ai so the other raid members perform their role perfectly
			- Probably much easier to implement once Raid Control is implemented
		
		Raid Control
			- Better for Raid Leaders to help manage their raid team
			- Easier to implement, as less ai is needed
			- Leads to a potential more "gamified" program
			
		I will begin with Raid Control and depending on progress will continue onto Single Control

	Controls
		Single Control
			- TBD
			
		Raid Control
			- If no outside input occurs, the character will do one of three things based on role
				- Damage: continue attacking the targeted enemy
				- Heal: heal injured party members that are within range
				- Tank: continue attacking the targeted enemy
				
			- If the player clicks and drags
				- Release on ground: character will move to the specified location and resume their
					idle action (defined above)
				- Release on enemy: if the character is a tank or damage, this sets their target to this enemy.
					if a healer, then moves.
				
			
			- If the player right clicks on the character, they will perform their cooldown ability
				- Tank: Mitigation cooldown. Prevents a percentage of damage taken. Commonly used when the
					boss is about to use an important ability
				- Healer: heavy raid-wide healing. Typically used when the raid takes large amounts of damage
				- Melee Damage: heavy single target damage to the targeted enemy
				- Ranged Damage: heavy area of effect (aoe) damage centered on the target

Art
	Characters/Enemies
		Super simple art. Role icons for player characters and simple portraits for enemies.
	
		Examples:

	UI
		Honestly just what unreal has default. Art is not my priority as I have no artistic skills :)
				
	Environment
		Minimal of what is needed to convey mechanics

AI
	Player Characters:
		- Move to point
		- Attack current target on timer
				or
		- Heal party member
			- Experiment here with what feels best
			- For now priority is
				- Low Health Tank
				- Low Health Damage
				- Injured Tank
				- Injured Damage
